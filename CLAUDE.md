# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

- **Start development server**: `npm run dev` (uses nodemon for auto-restart)
- **Start production server**: `npm start`
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`

## Architecture Overview

This is a Node.js/Express AI productivity agent that handles calendar appointments, email, and goal tracking through natural language conversation. The application consists of:

### Core Components

**Server Structure:**

- `server/server.js` - Main Express server with chat endpoint and OAuth routes
- `server/services/intentHandler.js` - NLP service using OpenAI + fallback local parsing
- `server/services/gmailService.js` - Gmail API integration for sending emails
- `server/services/calendarService.js` - Google Calendar API integration
- `server/services/freeTimeDetector.js` - Calendar availability analysis and recurring event slot detection
- `server/utils/googleAuth.js` - Google OAuth 2.0 authentication utilities
- `public/index.html` - Frontend chat interface

### Session Management

The application maintains stateful conversations through:

- In-memory session storage using JavaScript Map
- Active bookings tracking with confirmation workflow
- Multi-step intent handling (book ‚Üí collect details ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí execute)
- Email tracking via Gmail's built-in Sent folder

### Intent Processing

Two-tier intent recognition:

1. **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** (primary) - Structured JSON extraction for complex queries
2. **Local regex parser** (fallback) - Rule-based parsing when OpenAI unavailable

Supported intents: `create_event`, `cancel`, `reschedule`, `check_schedule`, `send_email`, `set_goal`, `redirect_to_goals`, `other`

**Chat Restrictions:**
- Main chat redirects ALL goal management requests (create/update/delete/read) to Goals section
- Chat maintains ability to modify calendar events created by goals
- Pattern matching detects goal-related keywords and returns friendly redirect message
- Ambiguous requests treated as calendar events with confirmation flow

### Google Services Integration

- **Calendar API**: Create, update, delete, and search events with automatic email notifications
- **Gmail API**: Send emails via authenticated user account
- **OAuth 2.0**: `/auth` and `/oauth2callback` endpoints for Google authorization

**Key Features:**
- Smart event search for cancel/reschedule operations by event title
- Context-aware date defaulting (e.g., "3pm" automatically selects today/tomorrow)
- Multi-step confirmation workflow for creating and modifying events
- Active reschedule state management to prevent intent conflicts
- Upcoming events sidebar with refresh capability
- Event detail modal with edit and delete functionality
- Direct API endpoints for event CRUD operations

### Environment Configuration

Required `.env` variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key for NLP processing
- `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for sending emails
- `EMAIL_PASS` - Gmail app password
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 3000)

### Frontend UI

**Main Interface:**
- Single-page application with dark theme
- Main chat area for general calendar/email interactions
- Sidebar showing upcoming events (next 7 days)
- Event cards clickable to open detail modal

**Goals Modal:**
- Dedicated goals interface accessible via "üìã Goals" button
- Separate chat area specifically for goal management
- Context-aware processing (sends `context: 'goal_management'` to backend)
- Examples shown: study hours, workout frequency, sleep targets, project deadlines
- Goal saved confirmation modal prompts user to find time or skip scheduling
- Smart recurring event scheduling with radio button time slot selection

**Recurring Event Scheduling:**
- Analyzes calendar availability in 30-minute increments across 4 weeks
- Returns ONE optimal slot per day per time preference (morning/afternoon/evening)
- Pre-selects first available slot matching user's time preference
- Shows 3 radio button alternatives for user selection
- Creates single Google Calendar recurring event using RRULE
- Hybrid strategy: goals >4 weeks use UNTIL date, ‚â§4 weeks use COUNT
- Deadline dates are inclusive (scheduled through end of deadline day)
- Supports daily, weekly, 3x/week, 2x/week patterns

**Event Management:**
- Event detail modal with view/edit modes
- Edit form with date, time, duration, location, description fields
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Real-time event refresh after modifications

### Goals Functionality

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ Intent detection for `set_goal` and `redirect_to_goals`
- ‚úÖ Goal description extraction via NLP
- ‚úÖ Context-aware goal vs. event disambiguation
- ‚úÖ In-memory goal storage with structured data (target amount, unit, frequency, deadline, time preference)
- ‚úÖ Smart recurring event scheduling using Google Calendar RRULE
- ‚úÖ Goal saved confirmation modal workflow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT IMPLEMENTED**: Goal progress tracking, completion updates, or persistent storage (database)

**How It Works:**
1. User opens goals modal (sends `context: 'goal_management'`)
2. Intent handler extracts structured goal data (target, frequency, deadline, time preference)
3. Goal saved to in-memory session storage
4. User prompted with confirmation modal: "Want me to find time for this goal?"
5. If confirmed, system analyzes calendar and finds available time slots
6. User selects from 3 time preference options (morning/afternoon/evening)
7. Single recurring Google Calendar event created with RRULE

**Example Goal Patterns:**
- "I want to study 10 hours before my exam" ‚Üí goal with deadline
- "Set a goal to workout 3 times per week" ‚Üí recurring goal
- "I need to sleep 7 hours every night" ‚Üí daily target goal
- "I want to finish my project by next Monday" ‚Üí project deadline

**Scheduling Algorithm:**
- Uses `freeTimeDetector.js` to analyze calendar availability
- Searches 4 weeks ahead (or until deadline if sooner)
- Returns ONE slot per day per time preference to avoid overlaps
- Calculates event count based on frequency and deadline
- Time preferences: Morning (6am-12pm), Afternoon (12pm-6pm), Evening (6pm-10pm)

### API Endpoints

**Chat & Auth:**
- `POST /chat` - Main chat endpoint with session management
- `GET /auth` - Initiate Google OAuth flow
- `GET /oauth2callback` - OAuth callback handler

**Event Management:**
- `GET /api/upcoming-events` - Fetch upcoming events (next 7 days)
- `PUT /api/events/:eventId` - Update existing event
- `DELETE /api/events/:eventId` - Delete event

**Goal Scheduling:**
- `GET /api/goals/:goalId/find-slots` - Analyze calendar and return available time slots (returns `timeOptions` array with morning/afternoon/evening alternatives)
- `POST /api/goals/:goalId/schedule-recurring` - Create single recurring Google Calendar event with RRULE

**Development:**
- `POST /reset-all-sessions` - Clear all in-memory sessions

### Development Notes

- Uses ES modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- Timezone hardcoded to Australia/Sydney in intentHandler.js and server endpoints
- Google credentials stored in `credentials.json` and `token.json`
- No testing framework currently configured
- Main entry point: `server/server.js`
- Session storage is in-memory (lost on server restart)
- Goals stored in-memory only (lost on server restart, no database persistence)
- RRULE format: `RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=7` or `RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20260630T235959Z`
- Recurring event deletion: Users can delete entire series from Google Calendar with one click
